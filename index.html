    <title>How Jokic is Dominating the NBA Finals</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The Passing</h1>
    <p>Jokic's most <em>unique</em> ability is his passing. This elevates his
    teammates' performamnce and can be comparable to the likes of <strong>Magic Johnson</strong>
    and <strong>Larry Bird</strong></p>

    <h1>The Rebounding</h1>
    <p>Maybe Jokic's most <em>underrated</em> skill. We have been accustomed to expect that big men
    should be great rebounders but this is just not true. Just look at Anthony Davis's stat line
    sometimes. LeBron and Austin Reaves sometimes have more rebounds than him and same goes for 
    Deandre Ayton. But Jokic is a glass cleaner and will punish the any team if he's not being boxed
    out properly.</p>

    <h1>The Scoring <em>With The Soft Touch</em></h1>
    <p>And this makes him close to being a perfect basketball player, combined with his other skills.
        The <strong>Softness</strong> of how soft his touch is a <strong>threat</strong>. He sometimes
        acts like a volleyball player when tipping in offensive rebounds and passing with one hand/touch.
        And no shot of his 100% defended because of this amazing skill.
